# Voyager

##### In light of recent ridiculous claims that I have been using open source PCBs for fame and money and that I am 100% liable for any of my open source PCBs that do not function, I am adding this disclaimer.
##### I provide these PCBs as a reference for designing keyboard PCBs. Using them within your projects will require a will to do research of one's own and to learn the workings of them, potentially fixing issues if they exist.
# I provide these PCBs without liability and without any guarantees regarding functionality, as expressed in the MIT license under which all of these PCBs are licensed.

### About
The Voyager series is a set of open source mechanical keyboard PCBs built around a set of basic features:
* RGB Underglow - On sizes 87 and smaller
* Per-key LED
* USB Type-C
* Overcurrent, ESD protection 
* MX/Alps compatibility
* Compatibility with QMK firmware.

The larger boards also have:
* Clean, aesthetically pleasing routing
* Flex slot cutouts for increased typing comfort

### The family
The series is a work in progress. More form factors coming soon.
